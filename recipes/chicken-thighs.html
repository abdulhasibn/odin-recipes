    <h1>Chicken thighs</h1>

    <h2>Baked Za'atar Chicken Thighs</h2>
    <p>Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are simply coated in za'atar and olive oil, then baked to perfection. The chicken gets a simple treatment because the za'atar spice mix imparts loads of flavor! Even better, it takes just a couple of minutes to prepare. I like these baked chicken thighs alongside a Middle Eastern inspired side dish, or try them in a wrap or green salad with a tahini dressing.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons za'atar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>   
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the za'atar, salt, and olive oil until the consistency of a thick paste. Add chicken thighs to the bowl, and toss to coat liberally on all sides. Place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
